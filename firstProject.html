  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p>This was my final Project for COP 3530 at UF, where I created a program that could recommend movies to someone based on knowing one of their favorite movies.
    It implements a page-rank algorithm to recommend a movie as a node in a graph.
    It includes two graph-based implementations: one as an adjacency matrix and another as an adjacency list.
    At the end of execution, it prints the recommendations and execution times obtained from running both graph-based implementations.</p>
